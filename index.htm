        <h1> A Little About Myself </h1>
        <p>Hello Everyone,
            My name is Lily Tsegaye. I am currently attending Year Up's Software Development track at the Seattle Central campus . I was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a country located in horn of Africa (East Africa). I attended Henry M. Jackson high school and graduated in 2018 . I then attended the Art Institute of Seattle until It was closed due to financial reasons. When I am free, I draw , create cloth designs and listen to music. I love listening to Da baby, Lil baby, Drake and J. Cole . </p>
